Some code utilities used during my studies.

"split-crypto.py" : 

  Description:
  This script allows to separate the different values (belonging to a file) located between a special character entered by the user.
  It also asks which column the user wants to extract and send to a file for further processing.
  Usage: in my cryptography class to decrypt passwords from a file.
