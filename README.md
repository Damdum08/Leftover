Some code utilities used during my studies or just for training

"split-crypto.py" : 

  Description:
  This script allows to separate the different values (belonging to a file) located between a special character entered by the user.
  It also asks which column the user wants to extract and send to a file for further processing.
  Usage: in my cryptography class to decrypt passwords from a file.
  You can try with the 'credentials.txt' file.


"broke_hash.py"

  Before : dl the rockyou.txt file on github and take the file 'hash_password' here.
  Description : Used to break password hash by performing a comparison with passwords from rockyou.txt file
  Look the name of your files before to use it.
